                    <h4>The school logo, comprises the Hansa, Lotus flower, an Open Book, an Oil Lamp and the mantra’ तमसो मा ज्योतिर्गमय ।।
                        The Hansa is considered as the symbol of purity, detachment, and knowledge. A very high level of symbolism is attached to hamsa as it transcends the limitations of the creation around it: it can walk on the earth, fly in the sky, and swim in the water.
                        
                        According to mythology the sacred bird, if offered a mixture of milk and water, is said to be able to drink the milk alone. It thus symbolizes discrimination between the good and the bad or the eternal and the evanescent This indicates that one must acquire and apply knowledge with discrimination for the good of mankind.
                        
                        The Lotus Flower: symbolizes divinity, fertility, wealth, knowledge and enlightenment. It represents long life, honor, and good fortune. It is untouched by the impurity despite growing in mud. It is also the National Flower of our country.
                        
                        The Lamp; the light in the lamp symbolizes knowledge. It removes darkness, which symbolizes ignorance.
                        
                        The wick symbolizes ego and the oil used symbolizes our negative tendencies. When we are lit by self knowledge, the negative tendencies (oil) melt away and finally the ego (wick) perishes.</h4>
